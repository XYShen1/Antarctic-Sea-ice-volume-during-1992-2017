# Antarctic-Sea-ice-volume-during-1992-2017

The sea-ice volume (SIV) data presented here were derived from satellite radar altimeters and passive-microwave radiometers, specifically, the ERS-1/2, ENVISAT and CryoSat-2, SSM/I, AMSR-E and AMSR-2, for 1992-2017. The data are polar stereographic projections with individual grid elements of approximately 50 km x 50 km; and the ice concentration data are also archived from OSI-SAF. 

The data sets provided here include the hemispheric totals and additionally the values for  five regions in the Antarctic. These regions are identified in Figures 1. Following Figure 1 there are data (in TXT) about SIV data in monthly scale for the Southern Hemisphere and each of the five Southern Hemisphere regions identified in Figure 1.
